- This Prework Study Guide was created with the intention of being a place to gather and take notes, as well as functioning as a practice project build, a place to hone and refine skills needed to begin the UCF Coding Bootcamp.
It contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript programming languages, as well as Git and Git Bash.
By completing this project I feel I have a firmer grasp on the basics of coding and am very excited to begin the course.
