        <h2>HTML</h2><br>
        <ul>
          <li>I have learned that the head element contains the instructions for the browser and must contain the meta data.
            Such as: meta charset="utf-8", which defines the character set to be used;
            meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge", which defines which browsers are compatible;
            meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", which defines how the content will be displayed;
            and the title for the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned that lang="en" always needs to go into the opening html tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned that 'img' tags always need a src attribute that links to a file on the computer, or
            a href attribute that links to an image on the web, as well as an alt attribute that will describe 
            the image for e-readers.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned that div elements can be used as needed, but more specific semantic elements are not only preffered but necessary for other developers to read and understand your code.

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2><br>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS selectors can be such things as class, id, or element names, which need to be applied and specified in the html file</li>
          <li>CSS rules are things such as font-size, width, height, background-color, and can set box parameters such as margin, padding, and border</li>
          <li>Link an html and css file by including "link rel=stylesheet href='file-location/style.css'" in the head section of your html file</li>
          <li>boxes can be made with css by setting a class attribute of container or card to div or section elements in your html file, and then setting your margin, width, and border parameters in your CSS file</li>
          <li>Debugging is an important and necessary step in the coding process, and an important skill to develop early. Look into youtube tutorials on how to use the debugging tools that are included in vscode and chrome.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently in</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls from github repository main branch to local repository</li>
          <li>git add -A stages the changes of ALL the files and folders within the current local repository</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit message goes here" commits your staged changes to the github repository</li>
          <li>git push, or git push origin branch-name: pushes your commited changes from local repository to github repository in the specified branch</li>
          <li>git push --set-upstream origin branch-name pushes commited changes and establishes your newly made branch</li>
          <li>Once a branch's goals are met and completed, it is necessary to merge it back into the main branch. To do this, create a pull request on github.com in the repository, create notes and request reviews, then merge the branch on the next screen. Return to your git bash and type "git pull origin main" to merge your local repository with the main branch.</li>
