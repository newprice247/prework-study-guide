        <ul>
          <li>I have learned that the head element contains the instructions for the browser and must contain the meta data.
            Such as: meta charset="utf-8", which defines the character set to be used;
            meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge", which defines which browsers are compatible;
            meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", which defines how the content will be displayed;
            and the title for the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned that lang="en" always needs to go into the opening html tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned that <img> tags always need a src attribute that links to a file on the computer, or
            a href attribute that links to an image on the web, as well as an alt attribute that will describe 
            the image for e-readers.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned that div elements can be used as needed, but more specific semantic elements are not only preffered but necessary for other developers to read and understand your code.
